```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Jatin-Sharma-11/Machine-Learning-Short-Projects.git](https://github.com/Jatin-Sharma-11/Machine-Learning-Short-Projects.git)
cd Machine-Learning-Short-Projects
### 2. Install Dependencies
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv). Refer to the individual project's readme.md for exact requirements.

Activate a virtual environment (example):

```Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
Install Common Libraries:

```Bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
# For deep learning projects:
# pip install tensorflow keras
### 3. Execution
Navigate into the folder of the desired project (e.g., cd Hull Tactical - Market Predic...).

Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```Bash

jupyter notebook
Open the corresponding .ipynb file and execute the cells sequentially.
