# 🤖 Machine Learning Short Projects

This repository is a curated collection of **short, focused Machine Learning projects** covering various tasks like classification, prediction, and deep learning applications.

The goal is to showcase different methodologies and quick implementations of ML models using various popular datasets and frameworks.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized into folders based on their primary domain or task. Each project folder contains the necessary code (usually a Jupyter Notebook: `.ipynb`), a dedicated `readme.md` for project-specific details, and sometimes a `description.txt` or other supplementary files.

### Projects List

| Category | Project Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | `drowsy-detection.ipynb` | A classification model likely for detecting driver drowsiness using computer vision or sensor data. |
| **Time Series/Prediction** | `CSIRO - Image2Biomass Pred...` | Project focusing on image-to-biomass prediction, potentially involving remote sensing imagery. |
| **Market Prediction** | `Hull Tactical - Market Predic...` | A prediction model focused on financial market forecasting or analysis, possibly using time-series data. |
| **Risk Prediction** | `Predicting Road Accident Risk` | A model for predicting the risk or severity of road accidents based on various contributing factors. |
| **Hiring Assessment** | `SRL-Intern-Hiring-Assessmen...` | Contains a machine learning project completed as part of an intern hiring assessment. |
| **Deep Learning/Audio** | `Speech2Score` | A project likely involving natural language processing (NLP) or audio processing to score or analyze speech. |

## 🛠 Getting Started

To explore and run the projects in this repository, you'll need Python and a few common libraries.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**
* **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for running the `.ipynb` files)
* **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Machine-Learning-Short-Projects.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Machine-Learning-Short-Projects.git)
    cd Machine-Learning-Short-Projects
    ```
    *(Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username, e.g., `Jatin-Sharma-11`)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Each project may have slightly different dependencies. It is recommended to create a **virtual environment** for each project or install the common libraries.

    *A generic set of common ML libraries:*
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
    # For projects involving deep learning or specific tasks:
    # pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python
    ```
    *Refer to the individual `readme.md` or the top of the Jupyter Notebooks for exact required packages.*

### Running a Project

1.  Navigate into the desired project directory.
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Select and open the corresponding `.ipynb` file (e.g., `drowsy-detection.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.
